<!DOCTYPE html><p>So, get this, right? I built the first version of <a href="https://loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.ong/">L(O*62).ONG</a> using server-side redirects, but Google slapped me with a security warning the very next day. Talk about a buzzkill! I had to scramble and switch to local redirects with a warning message before sending folks on their way. Then came the fun part – begging Google for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Now, the smart money would’ve been on using Google Safe Browsing for redirects. But here’s the catch: Safe Browsing’s got a daily limit – 10,000 calls, and that’s it. Plus, no custom lists. And since I’m all about keeping things simple and sticking with Cloudflare, Safe Browsing was a no-go.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a while back, I was chewing the fat with someone online, and bam! It hit me like a bolt of lightning. Why not use a secure DNS server with built-in filters for adult content and all that shady stuff to check if a domain’s on the up-and-up?  Figured I’d give <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families-zh-cn/">Family 1.1.1.1</a> a shot, and guess what? It actually worked!  Problem was, no custom lists there either.  Then I remembered messing around with Cloudflare Zero Trust Gateway back in my <a href="https://www.awesome-homelab.com/">HomeLab</a> days.  Turns out, that was the golden ticket – a solution so good, it’s almost criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the deal: Cloudflare Zero Trust’s Gateway comes packing a built-in DNS (DoH) server and lets you set up firewall rules like a boss. You can block stuff based on how risky a domain is, what kind of content it has, and even use your own custom naughty-and-nice lists. And get this – it pulls data from Cloudflare’s own stash, over 30 open intelligence sources, fancy machine learning models, and even feedback from the community. Talk about covering all the bases! Want the nitty-gritty?  Hit up the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/#docs-content">official documentation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>So, I went ahead and blocked all the high-risk categories – adult stuff, gambling sites, government domains, anything NSFW, newly registered domains, you name it. Plus, I’ve got my own little blacklists and whitelists that I keep nice and tidy.</p>

<p>Once I was done tweaking the settings, I got myself a shiny new DoH address:</p>

<p>To hook it up to my project, I used this handy-dandy code:</p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>async function isSafeUrl(</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  url,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  DoH = "https://family.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>) {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  let safe = false;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  try {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    const { hostname } = new URL(url);</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    const res = await fetch(`${DoH}?type=A&#x26;name=${hostname}`, {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      headers: {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        accept: "application/dns-json",</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      },</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      cf: {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        cacheEverything: true,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        cacheTtlByStatus: { "200-299": 86400 },</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      },</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    });</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    const dnsResult = await res.json();</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    if (dnsResult &#x26;&#x26; Array.isArray(dnsResult.Answer)) {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      const isBlock = dnsResult.Answer.some(</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        answer => answer.data === "0.0.0.0"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      );</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      safe = !isBlock;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    }</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  } catch (e) {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    console.warn("isSafeUrl fail: ", url, e);</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  }</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  return safe;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>And here’s the kicker: Cloudflare Zero Trust’s management panel has this sweet visualization interface that lets you see what’s getting blocked and what’s not.  You can see for yourself – it’s got the kibosh on some adult sites and those brand-spanking-new domains.</p>

<p>Oh, and if a domain ends up on the wrong side of the tracks, you can always check the log to see what went down.</p>
