<!DOCTYPE html><p>Yo, so I’ve been digging into this whole AI thing for front-end development lately, and stumbled upon this cool Transformers.js example.  Turned it into a sweet little tool, check it out!</p>
<p>Basically, it uses Transformers.js in a WebWorker to tap into WebGPU and run this RMBG-1.4 model.  Long story short, you can now use AI to nuke image backgrounds right in your browser. And get this, it only takes half a second to process a 4K image on my M1 PRO!</p>
<p>Here’s the link to the tool: <a href="https://html.zone/background-remover">https://html.zone/background-remover</a></p>

Oh, and heads up, you gotta be on Transformers.js V3 to mess with WebGPU.</p>
