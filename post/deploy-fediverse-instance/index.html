<!DOCTYPE html><p>I came across the concept of the Fediverse at the beginning of this year and found that it is the social network I have always envisioned: each instance is like an isolated island, connected through the network to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>As a self-hosting enthusiast, I wanted to deploy my own instance. I asked about the cost of self-hosting on Mastodon and found that the minimum cost is $15/year for a server and domain name. In order to reduce costs, I didnâ€™t purchase a VPS and instead deployed my own instance on my Homelab. It has been running for half a year with a few issues (mainly due to my tinkering) such as internet or power outages at home. Since downtime results in lost messages, I decided to migrate to a server.</p>
<p>Among the popular software, Mastodon has more features but consumes more resources, so I chose <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> which consumes fewer resources but still meets my needs. I deployed it on various free services, achieving a server cost of $0 with only the domain name cost remaining. It has been running stable for a quarter.</p>

<p>Remember, free things are often the most expensive. It is important to regularly back up the database and cloud storage.</p>
